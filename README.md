A generic project submission template.

## FAQs:
<b> Can I use Scikit-Learn for ... ? </b>

_For using ML models, NO. You are supposed to code them from scratch._ 

_For dataset preprocessing, YES. You can use built-in methods for splitting your dataset into train-test sets, for dimensionality reduction (e.g. using PCA) as a preprocessing step, for visualizing your high-dimensional datasets in a 2-D/3-D plots (e.g. using t-SNE, UMAP, etc) during exploratory data analysis (EDA)._ 

<b> Can I use Tensorflow Keras / PyTorch for ... ? </b>

_You are not expected to code every single neuron from scratch, so YES. You can use popular deep learning frameworks to - 1. design your custom neural networks, 2.  use some existing, pretrained networks for transfer learning or as a baseline._

<b> Can I add customize this template to suite my project? </b>

_Absolutely._
