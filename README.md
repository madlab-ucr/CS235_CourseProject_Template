## FAQs:
<b> Can I use Scikit-Learn for ... ? </b>

_For using ML models, NO. You are supposed to code them from scratch._ 

_For dataset preprocessing, YES. You can use built-in methods for splitting your dataset into train-test sets, for dimensionality reduction (e.g. using PCA) as a preprocessing step, for visualizing your high-dimensional datasets in a 2-D/3-D plots (e.g. using t-SNE, UMAP, etc) during exploratory data analysis (EDA)._
